# 5_Roll
This dice game is played between a human player and a computer player. Each player rolls five dice simultaneously and the score for each roll is the sum of the numbers shown on the faces of the dice.

The objective of the game is to reach a score of 101 or more. Alternatively, the human player can choose another target score before the game starts.

After each roll, the player has the option to score the roll or take up to two optional rerolls. For each reroll, the player may reroll all five dice or select any number of dice to keep and only reroll the remaining dice. A player can choose to score at any time, thus ending their current throw. However, after the second reroll, they must score the roll.

The game continues until one player reaches the target score or has the highest score in case of a tie. If both players reach the target score with the same number of attempts, a single attempt being considered as one roll followed by two optional rerolls, the player with the highest score wins.

In case of a tie, where both players achieve the same score in the same number of attempts, each player throws all five dice one more time and the player with the highest sum in that roll wins. No optional rerolls are allowed in this case. If the score is still tied, both players continue to roll all five dice until one of them wins.

Overall, this dice game offers players the opportunity to test their luck and strategy skills in a fun and challenging way against a computer opponent.
